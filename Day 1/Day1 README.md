# LaunchDarkly HTML Introduction

## Structure of the HTML Document
The HTML file is structured as follows:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type.
- `<html>` contains the entire page content.
- `<head>` includes meta tags and the title "Welcome to LaunchDarkly."
- `<body>` holds all visible content:
  - An `<h1>` for the main title.
  - An `<h2>` for the "Our Mission and Values" section.
  - A `<p>` explaining LaunchDarkly's mission.
  - A `<h2>` for "Core Values" followed by an unordered list `<ul>` with three values.
  - A link `<a>` to the LaunchDarkly homepage.
  - An `<img>` tag with a placeholder image and alt text for accessibility.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Ensuring Proper Structure**: Followed HTML best practices, including indentation and readability.
- **Placeholder Image and Link**: Used a placeholder URL and image, which can be replaced with real data later.
- **Accessibility**: Included `alt` text for the image for screen readers.
