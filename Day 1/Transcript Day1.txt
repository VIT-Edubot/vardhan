Transcript of HTML Structure



HTML Breakdown
1. Document Declaration
   - <!DOCTYPE html> is used to define the document as an HTML5 page.

2. HTML Tag & Language Attribute
   - <html lang="en"> specifies the document language as English.

3. Head Section
   - <head> contains metadata, including:
     - <meta charset="UTF-8"> for character encoding.
     - <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> for responsive design.
     - <title>Welcome to LaunchDarkly</title> to define the browser tab title.

4. Body Section
   - <body> contains visible content:
     - <h1>: "Welcome to LaunchDarkly" (main title)
     - <h2>: "Our Mission and Values" (subheading)
     - <p>: Short mission statement
     - <h2>: "Core Values" (subheading)
     - <ul>: Unordered list of core values (Innovation, Collaboration, User-First Mindset)
     - <a>: Link to LaunchDarkly homepage
     - <img>: Placeholder image with alt text

5. Best Practices Followed
   - Proper indentation for readability.
   - Comments explaining each section.
   - Use of semantic HTML tags.
   - Placeholder elements for links and images, ready for real content substitution.
